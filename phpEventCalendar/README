I. Summary

	phpEventCalendar is a mysql backed application that allows users to 
	post and display events or notes on month-at-a-glance calendar. Because 
	only authorized users can add events or posts, the calendar is perfect 
	for individuals or organizations looking to communicate upcoming events 
	to a larger audience. phpEventCalendar comes with a user administration 
	panel, and two user levels. One user type can post/edit events, and add 
	or edit users, while the other user type can only post/edit events.
	
II. Requirements

	* PHP 4.1.0 or later

	* MySQL 3.0 or higher
	
III. Installation

	1. Download pec-x.y.tar.gz (or pec-x.y.tar for Windows users)
	
	2. Untar/unzip phpEventCalendar into a directory on your server. 
	   Untarring/Unzipping with create a folder called phpEventCallendar, 
	   which will contain all the files 
	   
	3. Make changes to config.php. The file is fairly well documented.
	   
	4. In a browser, go to the URL for the createtables.php file, included 
	   in the distribution.  This step creates the database tables, and 
	   give you a link to the calendar if successful. 
	   
	5. Login to the calendar (link is at bottom) with the default user:

	    username: admin
		password: password

	   Once you are logged in, I recommend that you first visit the user 
	   admin page (link at bottom), and change your password. 

	6. Finally, delete the createtables.php file, and installation is 
       	   complete.


IV. Upgrading from v.0.2.1 to v.0.2.2: 

	No special steps need to be taken to update from 0.2.1 to 0.2.2 accept
	that you will want to replace the template and css files with the ones 
	you customized for your 0.2.1 installation.

IV. Upgrading from v.0.1 to v.0.2.2: 

    * note: phpEventCalendar version 0.1 inserted a value of "00:00:00" into 
      the database time fields if the user chose not to specify a start and 
      end time when adding an event.  It was neccessary to change this behavior 
      in v.0.2 to standardize the calendar's time functions, and to facilitate 
      the addition of a 24 hour time format that displayed times in the range 
      of 00:00 to 23:59. Version 0.2 inserts the value "55:55:55" as a 
      "no-time" value. This arbitrary value needs to be inserted in all 
      database records where both the start and end times are "00:00:00", if 
      "no-time" events are to contine to display no time.  You accomplish this 
      by running the script in step 8. However, be sure that everything else 
      is working before you make the database adjustment, or you will not be 
      able to revert back to version 0.1.
	
    1. Download pec-0.2.tar.gz (or pec-0.2.zip for Windows users) from the 
       downloads page. 

    2. If the directory on your server that contains your v.0.1 files is named 
       "phpEventCalendar", then change the name of that directory, so it is
       not overwritten when you untar/unzip the new release. 

    3. Untar/unzip phpEventCalendar into a directory on your server. All files 
       will untar/unzip under the folder "phpEventCallendar", which is part 
       of the archive. 

    4. Edit the config.php file. This file is completely different from the 
       previous config.php file, and so do not try to copy over your old 
       config.php file - it will not work 

    5. Delete the createtables.php file 

    6. Copy the template file you were using for version 0.1 to the "templates" 
       directory under the new release directory 

    7. The new release should now function properly, with one exception. 
       Events that should display no time will show 12:00AM-12:00AM. The next 
       step fixes this problem, but make sure everything else works as it 
       should before continuing the next step. See the note above. 

    8. In your favorite browser, go to the URL for the database_adjust.php 
       file, which is in the upgrade directory under the directory for the 
       new release. This file replaces the time value for events that have 
       no start or end time with the new "no-time" value, which is "55:55:55".
       See the note above. 

    9. Your upgrade is complete
